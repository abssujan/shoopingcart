# Project Overview

Welcome to my interactive value increment and decrement application! This project enables users to effortlessly adjust values by clicking plus and minus signs, dynamically updating prices in real-time. The key features include:

- **Increment and Decrement:** Clicking the plus sign increases the value, while the minus sign decreases it.

- **Dynamic Price Adjustment:** Prices are adjusted accordingly with value changes, providing a seamless user experience.

- **Subtotal and Total Updates:** Incrementing prices contribute to the subtotal, including tax calculations, and are then reflected in the main total section.

## Code Organization

The code is organized into three parts, with a specific emphasis on the implementation of the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle. A `utility.js` file has been created to house common functions, enhancing code modularity and maintainability.
